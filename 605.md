% How to Succeed in the Miami University Geography Graduate Program

# You and the Department

Compared to your role as an undergraduate, you will likely find
graduate school to be an adjustment. On one hand, academic expectations
rise fairly substantially, and you may feel yourself struggling at
times to keep up. On the other hand, most of you are also taking on
new roles as teaching assistants. At times you will likely feel these two
roles in some tension. This course is designed to prepare you for this
new experience, and to give you some tools and resource to draw on
as you adjust.

In the Miami Geography Department, there are two primary models
for the work that teaching assistants do:

1. primarily supplementing a lecture course by providing grading and
  logistical help
2. more direct instructions overseeing labs or discussion sections

The first case involves more background work where you will typically
not be interacting extensively with students, outside perhaps of
office hours. The second involves much more direct and extensive
interaction with students, where you are actually contributing to
instruction. Each role relies on different skill sets: the first in
particular on organization and attention to detail, and the second on
inter-personal communication. 

# Engaging Students

If you have a role as a teaching assistant, a large part of your
responsibility is to the students, and the professor, you serve. This
may be the most difficult transition for you, as you are asked to move
from being a typically-passive consumer of information, to now being
asked to help teach. No matter what your specific role, central to
doing this job well is learning how to *effectively engage
students*.

There are no silver bullet answers on how to effectively enage
students. What may work for one class or situation may not work well
for another. Above all then, success tends to be more likely when you
adopt certain habits, like:

Be Prepared
:    Know your material as well as you possibly can, and learn about
     your students as quickly as you possibly can. This knowledge will 
     give you more room to navigate as you encounter new issues and
     challenges.
Pay Attention and Be Responsive
:    So much of successful teaching is about interpersonal relations;
     not only between instructors and students, but also among
     students. To the degree possible, look to optimize these
     interactions to everyone's benefit. This suggests paying
     attention to when students are struggling, and when they're
     engaged, and then using that information to adapt. Take note of
     problems that crop up, and talk through them with others.

# Grading and Logistics

If student engagement puts you front stage in interacting with
students, grading and other logistical work associated with
maintaining a class is obvious background work. Nevertheless, as you
will see, the frontstage and backstage are linked.

# Balancing Priorities

As you might imagine, there will be times your two roles will be in
conflict. There are only so many hours in a week, and sometimes this
will involve strategic balance. The more organized and prepared you
are, the easier it will be to balance these priorities.

# Resources

Ultimately, success will come through the ability to adapt and to
adjust. Being able to do so will come from your ability to exploit
existing resources.

The Graduate Bulletin
:    You can pretty much think of this as the manual for the Geography
     MA program. Anything you need to know about policies and
     curriculum *should* be here; if it's not, ask.

The Howe Writing Center
:   The Howe Writing Center at King Library can be a resource to help
    your students with their writing. It can also be a resource to
    improve your own writing to reflect the heightened expectations of
    graduate school.
