# The Structure and Evolution of Academic Literatures

Creative and intellectual work always builds on work that has come before it. Academic research does not exist apart from its relation to a well-developed literature of already-existing work.

## Academic Literature

When considering any individual work within an academic literature, we might ask basic questions such as:

1. What ideas do the authors reference?
2. Who do they cite to characterize those ideas?
3. How do the authors understand potential debates around these ideas?

Broadening this perspective out to consider how the individual item fits in larger context, we might further ask:

1. How in turn does this item get cited by others?
