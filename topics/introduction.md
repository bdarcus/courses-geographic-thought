# Introduction

The argument here is:

1. Academic work is driven by ideas: evolving concepts and theories.
2. These ideas are developed and disseminated in a variety of ways, but most formally and concretely in the form of publications.
3. These publications are organized into a structured web of connections; what we call *literatures*.

In turn, our job as aspiring scholars is to:

1. *Identify* those ideas that excite us.
2. Figure out *how* these ideas are evolving, and *why*.
3. Place ourselves in this dynamic web; the existing literature.

Doing so allows to:

1. Figure out *what* we want to do with our own research.
2. Explain *why* it is significant and important.
