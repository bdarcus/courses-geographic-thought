% Issues You May Run Across in Teaching
% Bruce D'Arcus

Following are a list of scenarios you may encounter in dealing with
students and instructors.

1. Student asks you a question about course material, but you are
unsure of the correct answer. It is important you inspire confidence
in your students that you are in command of the material. Yet it is
also important that you provide them correct information.

2. Student comes to your office and complains about the grade you gave
them on an assignment. Your job is both to maintain consistent
standards, but more importantly to help students learn.

3. A group of students are being disruptive in class; obviously not
paying attention to what is going on, and distracting other
students. If you ignore them, you are certain to encourage the same
behavior in the future. If you call them out in front of the class,
you may embarrass them (and interestingly, annoy their colleagues as
well).

4. In a discussion session: you present the class what you think to be
an insightful question about the course material, but are met with
absolute silence. How do you draw students into a meaningful, engaged,
conversation? 

5. Instructor gives you instructions about how to grade an
assignment. You believe you follow their instructions correctly. You
find out later that the instructor has changed a grade on an
assignment after a student complaint.
