This book is about the variable and changing ways that geographers
have answered the question "what is geography?," and the contextual
factors that help explain those answers. It is about the
back-and-forth between world, and a changing discipline. Perhaps most
importantly, it is about *you*: learning how to place yourself in
this evolving world of ideas.
